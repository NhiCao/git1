Spring roll is one of my favorite dishes. A special thing about it is that you have a roll inside another roll and the whole thing is called Spring roll.
I have been craving for Banh Mi recently.
Your hair makes me get a craving for instant noodles.
I wish I could eat banh mi right now.
I am craving for so many dishes.
I can eat 2 portions of pho.
I need to get many things done today. It seems like a hectic day today.
It's raining outside.
Tomorrow is Monday. Goodness.
Granola.
